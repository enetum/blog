## Introduction

### What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a popular CSS Framework for developing mobile-first websites. Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s hottest front-end open supply toolkit, allows you to quickly style and customize sites. Bootstrap includes Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, in depth prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.

### Why use Bootstrap?

Not only is Bootstrap easy to use and speeds up the website development process, but it is also FREE! The code is open source and well documented as well. While it may seem daunting at first Bootstrap is easy to use and easy to learn. With Bootstrap you no longer have to write custom media queries for all your custom styles. You simply just need to add the classes you want to your HTML elements. Bootstrap also includes everything you need to style your website from icons to pre-built components and themes!

## Let's Get Started!

Below we will walk through how to install and use Bootstrap and customize to your needs with a simple walk through and using basic examples.

### How to Get Started with Bootstrap?

As mentioned before Bootstrap is a free front-end open source toolkit. To get started with Bootstrap all you need to do is visit the website [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). Once at the site click the ***"Get Started"*** button (see image below).

For this tutorial we will be using Bootstrap in our project through <link>'s in the <head> of our HTML files. Bootstraps docs provide a perfect starter template for exactly what we want to do here. Scroll down on the same page the ***"Get Started"*** button took you too (see image below).

Create an HTML file in your favorite text editor and save it as *index.html*. Go ahead and copy and paste the starter template code into the *index.html* file. The code should look exactly how it does on the Bootstrap page (see code block below).

<code>
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
